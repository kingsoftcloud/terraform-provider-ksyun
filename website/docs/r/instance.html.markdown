# ksyun_instance

Provides a KEC instance resource.

**Note**  At present, 'Monthly' instance cannot be deleted and must wait it to be outdated and released automatically.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ksyun_instance" "default" {
  image_id      = "${data.ksyun_images.centos-7_5.images.0.image_id}"
  instance_type = "S4.1A"
  system_disk {
    disk_type = "SSD3.0"
    disk_size = 30
  }
  data_disk_gb         = 0
  subnet_id            = "${ksyun_subnet.default.id}"
  instance_password    = "Xuan663222"
  keep_image_login     = false
  charge_type          = "Daily"
  purchase_time        = 1
  security_group_id    = ["${ksyun_security_group.default.id}"]
  private_ip_address   = ""
  instance_name        = "xuan-tf-combine"
  instance_name_suffix = ""
  sriov_net_support    = false
  project_id           = 0
  data_guard_id        = ""
  key_id               = ["${ksyun_ssh_key.default.id}"]
  force_delete         = true
}
```

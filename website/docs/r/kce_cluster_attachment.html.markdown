# ksyun_kce_cluster_attachment

Provides a KCE attachment resource that attach a new instance to a cluster.

#

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ksyun_kce_instance_images" "test" {
}

resource "ksyun_kce_cluster_attachment" "foo" {
  cluster_id = "67b91d3c-c363-4f57-b0cd-xxxxxxxxxxxx"

  worker_config {
    image_id      = data.ksyun_kce_instance_images.test.image_set.0.image_id
    instance_type = "S6.2A"
    system_disk {
      disk_size = 20
      disk_type = "SSD3.0"
    }
    subnet_id         = "subnet-xxxxxx"
    security_group_id = ["sg-xxxxxx"]
    charge_type       = "Daily"

  }
  advanced_setting {
    container_runtime = "containerd"
    pre_user_script   = "def"
    label {
      key   = "tf_assembly_kce"
      value = "on_configuration_files"
    }
    taints {
      key    = "key2"
      value  = "value3"
      effect = "NoSchedule"
    }
  }
}
```

## Import

KCE worker can be imported using the id, e.g.

```
$ terraform import ksyun_kce_cluster_attachment.default 67b91d3c-c363-4f57-b0cd-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

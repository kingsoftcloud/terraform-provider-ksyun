# ksyun_kce_cluster

Provides a KCE cluster resource.

~> **NOTE:** We recommend that uses the `ksyun_kce_cluster` resource to create a cluster with few `worker_config`.
If you want to manage more worker instances in this cluster, to use the `ksyun_kce_cluster_attach_existence` or `ksyun_kce_cluster_attachment` resource to attach the worker instances to the cluster. The reason is that the `worker_config` is unchangeable and may cause the cluster to be re-created because it is marked *ForceNew*.

#

## Example Usage

## basic dependency resources

```hcl
data "ksyun_kce_instance_images" "test" {
  output_file = "output_result"
}

data "ksyun_kce_instance_images" "test" {
}

variable "az" {
  default = "cn-beijing-6e"
}

variable "suffix" {
  default = "-kce-complete"
}
```

## create a ManagementCluster

```hcl
resource "ksyun_kce_cluster" "default" {
  cluster_name        = "tf-modification${var.suffix}"
  cluster_desc        = "description...modification"
  cluster_manage_mode = "ManagedCluster"
  vpc_id              = ksyun_vpc.test.id
  pod_cidr            = "172.16.0.0/16"
  service_cidr        = "10.252.0.0/16"
  network_type        = "Flannel"
  k8s_version         = "v1.23.17"
  reserve_subnet_id   = ksyun_subnet.reserve.id

  managed_cluster_multi_master {
    subnet_id         = ksyun_subnet.normal.id
    security_group_id = ksyun_security_group.test.id
  }

  worker_config {
    count         = 2
    image_id      = data.ksyun_kce_instance_images.test.image_set.0.image_id
    instance_type = "S6.4B"
